		With eviction moratoriums about to expire, thousands of New Yorkers are at heightened risk for COVID-19</h1>

	<p><b>31,426.</b> That’s how many evictions landlords in New York City have filed since Housing Court re-opened on June 20 (as of November 27). While just three legal evictions have been carried out since October 1, according to the city, protections for tenants impacted by COVID are quickly approaching their end. The CDC’s eviction moratorium is set to expire on December 31, 2020, followed by the state’s Safe Harbor Act on January 1, 2021. New Yorkers fear the new year will bring a wave of evictions — followed shortly by a new wave of the coronavirus.
<br><br>
“This is the calm before the storm,” says Katelyn Dooley, a staff attorney-in-training at The Legal Aid Society, the city’s largest civil rights and social justice law firm.
<br><br>
Researchers at UCLA recently published <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3739576">a national study</a> that found a link between evictions and the spread of the coronavirus: in the weeks after states lifted their eviction moratoriums, there were an estimated 433,700 excess COVID-19 cases and 10,700 excess deaths. In New York City, certain neighborhoods have significantly more evictions pending than the rest — in some cases, these are the same neighborhoods that have already suffered the most from the virus.<br>

	<p> In Highbridge and Mount Eden in the Bronx, COVID cases have risen in the past month and been consistently higher than others throughout the pandemic. These neighborhoods have seen some of the highest eviction rates in the city year after year. Corona, Queens, an early epicenter of the outbreak, has more legal evictions pending now than four surrounding zip codes combined. In previous years, this neighborhood didn’t even crack the top five zip codes for evictions. But in Staten Island, where COVID cases are also on the rise, high rates of homeownership mean that pending eviction numbers are generally low.

“If staying home and being isolated is how we beat the virus, it makes sense that evictions would cause deaths,” says Sumathy Kumar, a campaign organizer with Housing Justice For All, a statewide campaign of renters, houseless people and advocates.
<br><br>
“People can’t socially distance without a home,” says Kumar.
